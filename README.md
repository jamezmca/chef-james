**Maccaroni**

1. Bring a pot of water to boil and salt generously
2. Put pasta into pot of boiling water and leave
3. When pasta al-dente, remove from element, strain and then leave

**White Sauce**

> You need to constantly stir the sauce otherwise it will get lumpy and you're a failure

1. Put saucepan on low head, and put butter in pan
2. Once the butter has melted, add in the flour and mix until combined evenly
3. Put in 1/5 of total milk, and once again mix until the sauce is smooth and has no lumps or clumps of flour/butter combo
4. From now until when the sauce is complete, I forbid you from stopping stirring
5. Stir the sauce until it starts to thicken a little bit, and you can see streaks forming behind the spoon
6. Whenever the sauce becomes a bit thick, add another 1/5th of the available milk to the sauce, and repeat until all the milk is gone, and the sauce begins to once again thicken
    - If you arm and shoulder doesn't burn from the stirring, then stir harder
7. Once the white sauce, has begun the thicken and the milk is gone, add all the cheese and stir until the cheese has completely melted
8. Add in the salt, and the broccoli to the sauce
9. Add in the pasta (not neccessarily all of it, just until the sauce to pasta ratio is perfect and you have a creamy and delicious dinner that will clease you of all sin, dread, sorrow and despair)
